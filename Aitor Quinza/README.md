## Project Description
The software generates a game that the user needs to guess.

## Rules
- Answer your name question.
- Always with the inputs you have to write what it ask for.
- Choose the level you want to play.
- Write the number you think it is, but take care because you have limited tries.
- The script will finish after you guess the number or you reach all the available tries.

## Workflow
- When you open the script it will ask your name.
- Then the game gives you 3 levels to choose.
- After the user selects the level, the game will ask for a number.
- The script gives an answer about the chosen number by the user, saying if it's greater, lower or you guessed it.
- Finally, the game shows how many tries you did and if you guessed the number.

## Organization
Used Trello, as a Kanban Method, to keep track of the tasks to do and those pending tasks.

Inside the repository there's a folder called "*Aitor Quinza*".
Inside the folder are two files, the first is a Jupyter Notebook where you can see a detailed version with comments and the second one is a Python script you can download and run.
