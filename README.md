## Project Description
For this project, I have created a program that requests the player whether he needs to encrypt or decrypt a message, takes this and translates it into a pseudo binary code or viceversa.

<a id="rules"></a>
## Rules
The rules for the program are to state whether you want to "encrypt" or "decrypt" a message and to introduce a message. In case you need to decrypt a message, it is required that the message has been encrypted by the program itself, or an error will occur.

<a id="workflow"></a>
## Workflow
1- Sketch the flow of the program
2- Create the dictionaries for both encrypting and decrypting
3- Define the encryption/decryption process functions
4- Code the sequence for encrypting/decrypting a message
5- Testing
6- Error handling

## Organization
I organized my work with a trello board and sketching the flow of the program with paper and pencil to organize my mind.
My repository is pretty simple, with a README.md file, a .gitignore and the Jupyter Notebook.
