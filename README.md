## Project Description
Recreate the classic blackjack game using python. I wanted to develop a challenging project, that is way I chose this relatively complex game.

## Rules
The player attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21 (busted). If the player gets 21, that is a blackjack and he/she will receive 2.5 times his/her bet. If the player is busted, he/she lose the bet. If the player wins, he/she will receive the double of his/her bet. 

## Workflow
First I studied the game rules properly and made a pseudo-coding scheme. I identified which would be the main functions that I would need for this exercise. After that I started to code, I decided to do it modularly in order to prevent future problems and to have everything more structured.

## Organization
I used Trello to list my tasks, I was completing them one by one in an order.

The repository has 3 files: this README file, the slides for this presentation and the jupyter notebook file.
