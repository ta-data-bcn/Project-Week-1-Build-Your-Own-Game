    "The purpose of the game is to guess which balls the CPU has chosen and in what order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CPU will choose 4 of the 8 possible balls. The balls are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Red ball\n",
    "- Green ball\n",
    "- Blue ball\n",
    "- Yellow ball\n",
    "- Brown ball\n",
    "- Orange ball\n",
    "- Black ball\n",
    "- White ball\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes your turn to chose, keep in mind that the order in which you choose the balls is the key to win the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of each round you will know how many of the balls you have chosen:\n",
    "     1. They have the right color and are in the right position.\n",
    "     2. They just have the right color, but they are not in their position.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difficulty of the game is that you will not know which colors you have guessed and, in case you have guessed one or some of them, which ones are in the correct positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, you have a maximum of 9 rounds. If you don't get it right at the end of the ninth round...you lose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you find it too difficult? I will give you another clue: The CPU can only choose one ball of each color. In other words, there are no duplicate balls.\n",
