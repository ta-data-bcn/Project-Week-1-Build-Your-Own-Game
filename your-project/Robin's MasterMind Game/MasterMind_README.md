## Project Description
Write a short description of your project. Write 1-2 sentences about the game you chose to build and why.
- I chose Mastermind for its beautiful colours and its infinite possibilites
- I used to play it younger with my siblings (after this project I think I'm done with it ^^)

## Rules
- the Mastercoder will establish a secret hidden code made out of 4 coloured ball
- the player ie. the "Code Breaker" will have 10 shots to try tro break out the code by proposing at each round a combination of 4 coloured ball
- at the end of each round, the Mastercoder will give feedbacks on the player's proposal:
	~ white ball = the coloured ball is in the secret code, but not in the right position 
	~ red ball = good proposal, it's all good

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What are the steps you went through?
- breaking the rules & the game rounds in small pieces to understand more easily each step
- defining the steps to follow to play the game from round 1 to finishing it
- Creating several Jupyter versions (3 versions) to test out different ideas
- creating several functions defining the different steps of the game (PC chooses a Code to break; player has 10 rounds to break it etc.)
- each functions & tries is explained with Docstrings & #Comments to help me understanding later on the heck I was trying to achieve in the first place

## Organization
1 / How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a kanban board?

- Trello cards to organise the tasks divided (Created 3 Trello Label : Dev, Project Management & Presentation organisation) = organise the tasks in 3 areas and make it easier to 
- used several Jupyter Notebooks to test different versions & ideas
- created a lot of functions to test out ideas
- testing out all functions in different Notebook cells to test small parts of code
- put in #comment various parts of code to keep track of older code
- once it kind of worked, compiled all the code in one big cell
- playing several games to see the potential errors or limits of the code
- refining the code (rewriting loops, adding blank spaces for readability etc.)
NB: always putting Docstrings on functions to define them, to make the code readable

2 / What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.
- one simple folder including Code & the README (no additional document)

## Links
Include links to your repository, slides and kanban board. Feel free to include any other links associated with your project.
