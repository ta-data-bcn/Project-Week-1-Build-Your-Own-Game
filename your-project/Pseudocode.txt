I want to create a program that offers the user a safe random password with certain requirements. What does safe password mean?


Generate a random string of:
-alphanumeric (combination of letters and numbers)
-a fixed length. (16 characters)
-lower case and upper case.
-at least one special character

1. I will need to import some modules such as "random" and "strings"
2. I will need to generate a function (def)
3. The function will first print a greeting to the user "Welcome to the best random password generator ever!"
4. I will need to set the length of the password
5. I will need to set some lower case characters and some upper case 
6. I will need to set some special characters
7. The function will print a message including the password and the string "This is your new password: "
8. close the function
