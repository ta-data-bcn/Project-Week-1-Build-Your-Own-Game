## Project Description

This project is about a recreation in python of the classic Hangman Game. The main objective of this game is guess the word randomly selected, before we get hanged. 

As a guessing word game, Hangman is a fun game to learn spelling and new languages, and it was a favorite of mine during my childhood!

## Rules

There are several rules to take into account in this version of the game. 

- I have chosen simple words, therefore you only have 6 attemps to guess the word before you get hanged! 

- After the guessing word has been selected, you will be asked to enter a letter. The machine will check if your chosen_letter is inside the selected word and return the progress you have made guessing, and a list with the words you have said and the number of fails you have until now. 

- Before asking you to give a second input, you will be asked if you want to guess the entire world before continue to guess a letter. Answer yes or no and either try to guess the word or keep playing. 

- Once you have reached 6 failed attemps, or you have guessed every word in the letter but haven't named the word outloud, you will loose and the game will stop. On the other hand, if you guess the word, you would have win! 

## Workflow

1. After selecting the game I started planning and laying out the logic of the game in a text file. While I was going through the logical steps of the game, I took notes of the possible coding formats I could use and defined a must-have and a nice-to have list of features. 

2. Once I was sure of the process I wanted for the machine, I started coding the basics of the game, that's the must-have of the game. I worked until the simplest features worked and after that, I started trying to improve the code and add some more features. 

3. After having what I wanted with the time I had, I started thinking of possible inputs that could break the flow and debug the program. 

4. Once the code was finished, I worked on the documentation. 


## Organization

On the first step, while I was planning the logic and steps of my game, I also laid out a trello board where I placed all the steps that were necessary to commit my work. 

My repository on the other hand, is divided in three different structures:

1. The project folder has an image folder where I have put all the pictures I needed on the presentation and this file.
2. The your-project folder has all the files I worked with to put together the game, and it stores a python file with the main function I use on my final project file.
3. The other file stores my presentation.
