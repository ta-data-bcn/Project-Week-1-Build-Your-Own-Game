## Project Description
_Guess the namber_ is a game that challenges you to find a number.

## Rules
There are two different levels, pick one and then enter your guess.
If it is not the right number then you will have a hint, if it is: congratulations! You guessed the number.
You will have 5 tries.

## Workflow
1. Research about the game.
2. Design the game structure, what do I want to do in the game?
3. Code the game and try it.
4. Turn in the final project.
5. Prepare the slides for the presentation.

## Organization
To organized myself during the project I have written the process on a task list to have a perspective of the steps I had to follow. 
My repository includes the code of the game and this READ ME file where I introduce the project.
