## Project Description
The goal of the project is to create a game through programming and make it work.
The choice for this project is Stop the Bus, a childs game focused on categories and words. 

## Rules
First, decide how many rounds will have the game
Afterwards, the game starts.
A random letter is generated and each team has to find a word for each category. This word has to start with the letter chosen at the beginning of the round.
Once all the categories are filled, the round ends. The sum of the lenght of each word will be compared in between each team. The one team with the largest lenght, wins the round and scores +1
The game ends when there is no more rounds.
The team with higher score wins.

## Workflow
In the first place, I decided wich steps I needed for the whole project.
Then, I decided the order for each step and started developing the game.
Once the coding was done, I checked for the bugs that I was able to fix.
Finally I tried to run the program part by part, then the whole thing together.

## Organization
I used Trello

My repository have a folder with the functions I wanted to use, a couple of word documents with the rules and the workflow and all the documents generated through the programming.
