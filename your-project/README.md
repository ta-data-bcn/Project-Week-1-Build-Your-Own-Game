## Project Description
I chose Hangman because it was one of the game I could relate to the most, given I used to play it a lot when I was a kid. On top of that, I chose to make it about the Disney Classics given my mum claims she is an expert on the topic so this could be an actual way to test it!

## Rules
One player thinks of a word or phrase; the others try to guess what it is one letter at a time. The player draws a number of dashes equivalent to the number of letters in the word. If a guessing player suggests a letter that occurs in the word, the other player fills in the blanks with that letter in the right places.

## Workflow
1. I planned out the steps I wanted to follow prior to coding.
2. I started reserarching about the game to be clear in all the instructions to consider.
3. I did a Pseudocode in my notebook, and a tree to try to understand the flow of decision making.
4. I worked on the code in Python, which took me most of my time.
5. Once the project was finalised, I worked on all the complimentary docuementation.

## Organization
Overall planning
I am very used to writing in notebooks as I like to draft my ideas on paper. Nonetheless, I was exposed to new tools such as Kanvas so I am planning to incorporate it more and more in the future.

Repository
I have grouped the material of my repository in 2 categories:
Project Files : Which include any file which is being read from my program.
Your Project :  Which includes the final version of my project as well as the Read_Me file.


## Links
Include links to your repository, slides and kanban board. Feel free to include any other links associated with your project.
