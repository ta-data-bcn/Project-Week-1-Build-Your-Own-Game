## Project Description

This project is a simple random password generator. It provides a strong password for the user and the checks whether the user is happy with their strong password. Also, it offers another option with a password that is easier to remember. I chose to build this program because I always struggle with passwords!

## Rules

The password generator must provide a random string with the following requirements:
-Be 16 characters long
-Include uppercase letters
-Include lowercase letters
-Include Special characters
-Include Digits



## Workflow

Outline the workflow you used in your project. What are the steps you went through?

The code imports all relevant modules
It defines a function that creates a random string that will serve as password for the user
It then defines a function that interacts with the user
Afterwards, it defines a function that checks if the user is happy with the password and if not offers to try a different password
It defines another function that prints text asks the user if she/he is happy with the new password. If the input is n it prints text offering another password that will be weaker but easier to remember
If the user inputs "y", it asks she/he to:
    - input a sentence 
    - input a digit
    - input a digit
    - input a digit
    - input a special character
It prints out the password
It asks if the user is happy
The program finishes
