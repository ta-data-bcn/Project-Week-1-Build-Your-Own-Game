## Project Description
The Password Generator creates a password according to your wishes after responding to a few essential questions. For a strong password there are a few recommendations as well. I chose it among the others as it looks simple and practical in the same time. I am going to use it for my personal needs and will never have the same passwords as I used to so far.

## Rules
Respond to a question with an integer from 4 to 32
Respond with Y (for Yes) and N (for No) to the other 4 questions


## Workflow
First, there is un input function asking to choose an integer number between 4 and 32.
Then, again input functions to questions if the user would want the password to include Uppercase letters, Lowercase letters, Number and Symbols. But to those the answers are only with Yes or No.
Each of those answers create a variable.
After that I put all the created variables and conditions into a new function called Password Generator.
Last step is the generated password.

## Organization
I organized the whole process of the project in Trello. For the code itself I used Jupyter Notebook. For the slides I used Power Point 

The repository includes a folder your-project and a md file Kick-Off explaining the requirements. The folder includes a README file with the detailed explanations about the project and the Jupyter Notebook file that includes the code iteself.
