## Project Description
The action of a Caesar cipher is to replace each plaintext letter with a different one a fixed number of places down the alphabet. 

## Rules
Yoy need to input either an encrypted message to decrypt or a simple text message to encrypt

## Workflow
- Researched about the type of encryption I wanted to make 
- Split the program into two blocks of code for each functionality
- Wrote the code and tested it
- Once it was working as expected I started the error handling

## Organization
I used the Trello Kanban board linked below

The repository is structured the same way as the master I forked from. Inside the "Your Project" directory you may find the directory for the "Encryption Tool". Inside this directory you may find the Jupyter Notebook file containing the code and an image to ilustrate the encryption.

## Links
Include links to your repository, slides and kanban board. Feel free to include any other links associated with your project.
