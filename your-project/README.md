## Project Description
Black Jack is a worldwide known gambling game which has the aim to score 21 or get as close as possible without going over that score.
I have chosen to build it because I thought it would be easy...

## Rules
Make your bet (don't break the bank, be responsible) and follow the game instructions.

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What are the steps you went through?
I used the Trello board for help, breaking the game into small steps and followed them

## Organization
I used the Trello board for organisation, breaking the game into small steps and followed them.

I kept my repository as simple as possible, using only one jupyter notebook and readme file
