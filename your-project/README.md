## Project Description
In our group we had to choose between Hangman and the other well known game called Tic Tac Toe. I used to play Hangman with my friends when I was young so that's the main reason why I chose this game. 

## Rules
- Play with a group. 
- Someone guess a word and writes it down.
- Have a person select a letter of the alphabet.
- If the letter is contained in the word/phrase, the group or individual takes another turn guessing a letter.
- If the letter is not contained in the word/phrase, the group or individual need to try again, a portion of the hangman is added. 

The game continues until:
- the word/phrase is guessed (all letters are revealed) – WINNER or,
- all the parts of the hangman are displayed – LOSER

## Workflow
1. Read the requirements
2. Open a new Trello card for the project
3. Read the requirements again and adding everything to the To Do list in Trello
4. Read the rules of the game
5. Planning the steps of the game and adding to the To Do list - find an order
6. Fork, clone repo, open Jupyter Notebook
7. Coding until don't have the core of the code - troubleshoot, save
8. Meeting with the TA
9. Update README
10. Start preparing the presentation
11. Go back to the code and add features
12. Update README, update presentation


## Organization
To have my work organized I used Trello.

For this project I created a new folder in my Ironhack/Week1 folder and called Project1_v4. Here I saved my repository.
In my repository I have Hangman .ipynb file. Also, there's the .gitignore file.
