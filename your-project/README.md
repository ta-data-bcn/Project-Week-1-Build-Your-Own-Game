## Project Description
Classical "Hangman" game with a country thematic.

## Rules
The rules are really simple:
* You might fail a maximum of **10 times**.
* The input can only be letters from **A-Z** and **blank space**.
  * Empty space or more than one character is not allowed.
  * Exception: You can also type **1**, but **this will stop the game**.

## Workflow
The workflow for Hangman was the following:
1. Research the rules of the game.
2. Pseudocode the game structure in a notebook. Later on, pass it to Jupyter Notebook.
3. Research code of that game to fulfill gaps not initially considered.
4. Meeting with TA for an explanation of the idea, seek more improvement and advice on different parts of the coding.
5. Start coding the game. At the same time, test the code to ensure everything runs smoothly.
6. Second meeting with TA. Show the progress and parts where I'm stuck. Solve the issues mentioned in the meeting.
7. Polish the final details.

## Organization
The organization of the project was divided into two. The whole project was organized through Trello but, the coding part, on the Jupyter Notebook itself.
After the whole code was finished, the part of the Jupyter Notebook was removed.

My repository looks the following way:
* To access the project, you should go to *your-project*. Inside that folder you will find the following documents:
  * *Project1 - Hangman*, where you can locate the code.
  * *README* where you can find the explanation of the project itself.
  * *.gitignore* to ignore some files/directories.
