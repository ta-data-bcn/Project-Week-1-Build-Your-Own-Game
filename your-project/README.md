## Project Description
The aim of this project is to create a game of Mastermind. In this game, the user will be guessing against the sequence generated by the computer.

## Rules
This one player game takes on the computer, that will determine a combination of 3 pegs. The pegs can be coloured RED, GREEN or BLUE. Each colour may be used more than once, or not at all.
As the player, each guess of the computers colour sequence and combination is made by inputting the guess into the interface.
Feedback will be provided on the guess. WHITE means correct colour but incorrect position. RED means both correct colour and correct position.  is made by placing a row of code pegs on the decoding board.
The player has XXX rounds to try and guess correctly and should base subsequent attempts on the feedback already provided.
