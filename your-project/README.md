## Project Description
The project consists of writing a Hangman game in Python 3. I chose Hangman as I thought it would be a good challenge and would require use of object-orientated programming. 

## Rules
The game requires the player to guess a word, one letter at a time. To win, the player must guesses the word correctly. However player looses if they do not guess the word correctly after a specific number of attempts, the player loses.

## Workflow
I first researched the game, then pseudo-coded with pen and paper. I then coded the game mostly using functions to establish the game logic. 

## Organization
I used Trello to itemise my tasks and to keep track of where I am at. I used git to commit files to my GitHub, and .gitignore to ensure that I didn't upload anything unnecessary! 

What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.
My repository consists of the main Jupyter Notebook which contains the code for the game.
It also includes a folder where the list of words, to be used by the game, is stored and called from. 

## Links
Include links to your repository, slides and kanban board. Feel free to include any other links associated with your project.
