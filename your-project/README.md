## Project Description
Write a short description of your project. Write 1-2 sentences about the game you chose to build and why.

'Open Sesame' is a password generator made simple. The user decides all the inputs his password should include and then 'Open Sesame'generates is on their behalf and provides it. 

## Rules
Briefly describe the rules of the game.

Simple rules:
The user is given some advice on what a strong password should include such as:
- Length
- Upper/lower case character(s)
- Symbol(s)
- Number(s)

The user is then supposed to make his decision about which inputs to include by answering a set of questions.

After the last question, the necessary inputs are gathered in order to be processed.

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What are the steps you went through?

First, I researched the best practices when creating strong passwords in order to manage my expectations and set some guidelines to pursue.

Second, I decided on the minimum amount of information I deemed fit for a strong password, I wrote them down in order of importance in case I get stuck at one so that I can discard them accordingly if need be.

Third, I wrote down the flow (pseudo code) to give me a framework to follow and check my progress.

Fourth, I started coding and assessing if I am able to apply what a strong password should include.


## Organization
How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a kanban board?

First and foremost, I broke up my work into smaller pieces of acheivables rather than let it overwhelm me (for example writing this is a small acheivable).

To track all my small measurable targets I used Trello. It was essential in  enabling me to gather my thoughts and progress in my task.
