## Project Description
The project consists in building "The Hangman" game and use at least one function in its coding. I chose this game because its rules are simple and it is easy fun.

## Rules
The user must guess a word randomnly selected by the program. 
Wrong guesses must be less than 6 in order to win. Otherwise, the user loses. 

## Workflow

Preparation of the workspace (Github: folder, documents)
Analysis and drawing of The Hangman's usual game structure.
Brainstorming of what Python objects could I use to build that structure.
Code game.
Test game.
Error handling.
Presentation preparation (readme file and slides).

## Organization
For organizing my work I used Trello.

The repository is simple and includes:
- Game code
- Readme file
- Gitignore file
