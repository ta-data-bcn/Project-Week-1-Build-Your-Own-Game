## Project Description
Ironhacker will have two opportunities out of ten options to win the game. 

## Rules
Ironhacker may guess a number between 1 and 10, during the first round it will inform if the number is higher or lower.

## Workflow
At the time of using widgets the Ironhacker may select the number option and use the for conditional in order to give the result of the guess.

## Organization
First at all think about the project, in order to have clear the game that you want to code. Then think how you can introduce the widgets to your game. Finally, start coding from the easy part until the code gives you the right answer and then start increasing the difficulty.
