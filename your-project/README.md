## Project Description
I chose to program Blackjack as it is one of my favourite games. The goal was to use functions and to make it as interactive and as close to the original rules as possible.

## Rules
Player vs. Dealer
Each get 2 Cards
Player only knows one of the Dealer’s cards
Deck
A can be either 1 or 11
Goal is to reach a Sum closer to 21
21 is Blackjack
Player loses if his sum is more than 21
Or if his sum is further from 21 than the dealer’s cards sum

## Workflow
First I was very disorganized, started researching the rules and created a simple version of Blackjack while taking notes of what else I wanted to add.
After that I created a Trello Board in which I organized my to-dos.
From then on I worked alongside the Trello Board.

## Organization
My repository now has a .gitignore file and inclues four Versions of Black Jack that I kept to view my progress and keep my learnings. The Version 4 is the final and best Version.
