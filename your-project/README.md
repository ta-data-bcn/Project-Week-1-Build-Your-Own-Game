## Project Description
I decided to choose the Hangman game as it seems to me to have a clear clonological order so as to code. This game consists on finding the missing letters in order to guess a word. 

## Rules
It will appear some blank spaces representing the missing letters you need to find. The machine will tell you to write a letter in order to guess the word. If you choose the letter that is in the word, that letter, which is in the word, will be revealed.
If you guess a letter wrong you will loose a life,. You start the game with 11 lifes. 

## Workflow
In order to do my project, I decided to follow some steps. First of all, I decided to create a trello project so as to planificate my ideas. There, I wrote all the steps I had to do. Before coding, I clone the repository and I create the gitignore file. Then, I decided to plan in a white paper how were going to be the code project. After that, I realized I had to revise some theoretical material in order to do the project. Being all that done, I started coding. 

## Organization
I used the trello web to organize my project. 

I create the file Hangman game in my folder which I cloned from github.
