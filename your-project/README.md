## Project Description
I created a Blackjack game. It is with 1 player and the dealer.

## Rules
If the total of your hand is more than 21, you are dead.
If the total of your hand is less than 21 but more than the total of the dealer's hand, you win.

## Workflow
I categorized the code per round.

## Organization
I wrote my planning down manually.
