## Project Description
In this game we are going to perform a ROT13 encryption. It is a very simple encryption which consists in switching the position in the alphabet each letter by 13 places.

## Rules
Please answer the question posed by the computer. Wait for it to work. You can check back to decrypt the code. This way you can send secret messages with your crush or with the CIA lol.

## Workflow
I first searched for information on a simple encryption method to start. Afterwards I looked for code that I could understand and also work on it and make it more complete.

## Organization
How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a kanban board?
I used the Trello template, and then I tried on several cells separated to try to code from the very start and make the code bigger step by step.

The repository for this project contains a folder with the main code, this README file and a .gitignore file, which is hidden.
