## Project Description
Program for encrypting and decripting messages using the "Caesar algorythm". 

## Rules
The program will ask the user whether the user wants to encrypt or decrypt the message he or she will introduce. If the user wants to decrypt de message, the message will need to be encrypted with the same program.

## Workflow
* Researching about encrypting algorithms
* Define functions for encrypt and decrypt
* Write code
* Identify errors

## Organization
The project has been outlined and organized through the tool Trello. For developing the workflow of the program, pencil and paper have been used. 

The repository containing the program consists of a folder that contains the main code with a Jupyter Notebook, a README file and a .gitignore file.
