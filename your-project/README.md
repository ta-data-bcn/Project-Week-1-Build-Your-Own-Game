## Project Description
This project is not really a game, but neither it is to forget every password I create (even the easy ones) and I play it everyday, so, why not create a difficult but secure password that I am allowed to forget properly ?
The random password creator allows the user to create a password that includes lower and upper case, digits and symbols and includes the option to have a customisable password length that can range between 6 and 25 characters (variable default length of at least 15 characters).

## Rules
There are no rules only passwords to create. Let the password games begin and may the odds be ever in your favor!

## Workflow
The workflow followed was the following:
- Planning the structure of the password and the steps to follow 
- Retrieving the project folder from github and cloning it
- Creating a .gitignore file
- Coding the password generator (different methods were tried before achiving the most appropiate one)
- Debbuging the password generator
- Improving the generator interface and visualization
- preparing the read.me file with the game description
- preparing the Power point presentation

## Organization
In order to follow the steps I needed to follow I used the kanban board Trello interface.
