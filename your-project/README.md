## Project Description
It is an alternative version of the Guess a number game. There are a magician who randomly takes a number out of his hat and the player who tries to guess the number. 


## Rules
The magician takes a randomly number out of his hat between 1 and 30. Later, the magician asks the player to guess that number in a maximum of 5 attempts. 

For each attempt failed, the magician gives a hint on whether the number to guess is lower or higher than the number guessed on the previous attempt.

If the player can make it in less than 5 tries wins the game. Otherwise, he loses. 


## Workflow
1. First of all, defining out the tasks to do via Trello. 

2. Then I started to set the rules of the game and think how to go through out of the code. 

3. Afterwards, I have been aplying these rules and translating them into coding. Starting by defining a random function for the magician and an input function for the player, as giving some conditionals for each possible scenario regarding on player's answer.

4. Finally, trying to automatise the game by importing 'sleep' function from 'time' module so the game could go as smooth as possible.


## Organization
I used Trello board to set the tasks and then like old-school, writing down to process to go through in a notebook with the main ideas I went encoutering and how I wanted the game to be. It really helped me to write these lines and later adapting them when passing from just written notes to real code.

Regarding to the repository structure, it is divided on a folder where we can find embedded on it this Readme file and the code notebook of the game itself and the .gitignore text file.
